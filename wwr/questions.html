        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <div class="q1">
        <h2>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="q1answer">
        <h3>Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over the age of 8 seem to
            enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). A common concern we get
            from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very
            few bored children of any age. The areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you
            never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things very interesting. Each
            boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river guides are unable to go for very long at all
            without telling stories...some of which are even true!</h3>

    <div class="q2">
        <h2>Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="q2answer">
        <h3>As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides
            are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common
            injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land. 
            Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). Many non
            swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk before
            your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.</h3>

    <div class="q3">
        <h2>What is included in the trip?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="q3answer">
        <h3>We will provide all necessary camping equipment. This includes a sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, small
            waterproof day bag, tent and a cot, eating utensils and camping chair. 
            We provided water and lemonade during the day. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate are provided during the morning and evening hours.
            You may bring beer, liquor and soft drinks (in reasonable amounts, 2 cans per day). You may purchase these items either the
            night before the trip, or on your way to the put-in. 3 meals per day, plus snacks.
            </h3>

    <div class="q4">
        <h2>How far in advance should I book my trip?
        </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="q4answer">
        <h3>If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in advance. If you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is usually sufficient.
        </h3>
